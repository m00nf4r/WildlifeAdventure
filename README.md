# 🌿 Wildlife Adventure

A 2D educational game that raises **biodiversity awareness** in children, set in Malaysia's **Belum-Temenggor rainforest**. Players take on the role of **Wira the Hornbill**, a Junior Ranger who explores the forest, discovers endangered wildlife, cleans up pollution, and tests their knowledge in a quiz — all while learning about real Malaysian species and conservation.

Developed as a **Final Year Project (FYP)**.

> **Built with:** Unity 6 · C# · Cloud Firestore + Firebase Authentication (REST API) · WebGL

## 📖 About the game

Wildlife Adventure teaches conservation through play. As Wira the Hornbill, the player:

- **Explores** a side-scrolling rainforest habitat.
- **Discovers wildlife** by scanning animals, unlocking illustrated **Fact Cards** saved to a **Field Journal**.
- **Cleans up pollution** (litter, plastic, bottles) to earn Conservation Points.
- **Takes a Level Quiz** once all animals are found, reinforcing what they learned.
- **Earns a Ranger Rank** (Ranger Cadet → Junior Ranger → Senior Ranger → Nature Hero) based on their score.

The featured species are all real and native to the region: the **Malayan Tapir**, **Malayan Tiger**, **Sumatran Rhinoceros**, and **Asian Elephant**.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

| Area | Technology |
|---|---|
| Engine | Unity 6 (2D, Built-in Render Pipeline) |
| Language | C# |
| UI | Unity uGUI (built from code at runtime) |
| Backend | Google Firebase — **Cloud Firestore** + **Firebase Authentication** (Email/Password) |
| Connection | Firebase **REST API** (no SDK — works identically in Editor and WebGL) |
| Target platform | WebGL (also runs in the Editor and as standalone) |

The entire game is generated from code at runtime by a single `GameBootstrap` script — there is no hand-authored scene, which keeps the project lightweight and version-control friendly.

---

## 🚀 Getting started (run it locally)

1. Install **Unity 6** (via Unity Hub).
2. Open the project in Unity (it will compile automatically).
3. Make sure the **Unity UI (uGUI)** package is installed: *Window → Package Manager → Unity Registry → search "uGUI" → Install*.
4. Set the input system: *Edit → Project Settings → Player → Other Settings → **Active Input Handling → Input Manager (Old)*** (the game uses the classic Input Manager).
5. In the scene, create an empty **GameObject** and add the **`GameBootstrap`** component to it (*Add Component → GameBootstrap*).
6. Press **Play**, then open the **Game** tab.

With the Firebase fields left blank, the game runs in **offline mode** — perfect for a quick test.

## ☁️ Firebase setup (for the online version)

To enable accounts, cloud-stored content, and the leaderboard:

1. Create a project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Register a **Web app** and copy the **Web API Key** and **Project ID**.
3. Enable **Authentication → Email/Password**.
4. Create a **Cloud Firestore** database (production mode).
5. Publish these security rules:

   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /wildlifeFacts/{doc}  { allow read: if true; allow write: if request.auth != null; }
       match /quizQuestions/{doc}  { allow read: if true; allow write: if request.auth != null; }
       match /users/{uid}          { allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid; }
       match /scores/{doc}         { allow read: if true; allow create: if request.auth != null; }
     }
   }
   ```

6. In Unity, paste your **Web API Key** and **Project ID** into the `GameBootstrap` component.
7. Press Play → **Create Account** → click **"Upload content to Firebase"** once to seed the wildlife facts and quiz.

The Web API Key is **not a secret** — it is safe to include in a client build; access is controlled by the security rules above.

### Firestore collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users/{uid}` | Player profile and progress (best score, rank, discovered species, plays) |
| `wildlifeFacts/{id}` | The Fact Card content |
| `quizQuestions/{id}` | The quiz bank |
| `scores/{autoId}` | Leaderboard entries |

---

## 🌐 Building for WebGL

1. *File → Build Profiles → Web/WebGL → Switch Platform* (install the WebGL module if prompted).
2. Add the open scene to the build.
3. **Build**, then upload the output folder to a static host (itch.io, GitHub Pages, etc.).

Firebase's REST endpoints send permissive CORS headers, so authentication and Firestore calls work from a hosted WebGL build. (They will not work from a `file://` path — the game must be served over http(s).)

## 📝 Notes

- The game's content (fact cards and quiz) lives in Firestore once seeded, but a built-in copy in `WildlifeDatabase.cs` serves as both the seed source and the offline fallback.
- Sprite artwork is loaded by name from `Assets/Resources/Sprites/` — no manual Inspector wiring needed.
